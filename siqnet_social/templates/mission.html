  <h2 style="text-align: center; margin-top: 40px;">üî• Our Philosophy</h2>
  <p style="font-size: 18px; max-width: 800px; margin: auto; text-align: center;">
    The Zulu Principle of Communicative Silence teaches that silence is a strategic force ‚Äî a language of restraint, reflection, and respect.
    SIQ (Silence Intelligence Quotient) is our universal metric for influence. It measures how individuals use silence to lead with integrity, create with clarity, influence with empathy, and connect across cultures.
    At SIQNet, we reward creators not just for what they say ‚Äî but for how they listen, reflect, and elevate others.
